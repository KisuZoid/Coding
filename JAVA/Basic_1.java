/*
 * #Code Explain:-
 * : Everything in java should be written in class. 
 *      name of the class will be same as name of the file.
 *          ex: file name "Main.java" means class name will be "Main".
 * : Java is case sensative. i.e. "Myclass" and "myclass" is different.
 * 
 * : "println()" -> here "ln" will terminate the line after printing the item inside parentheses.
 * : "print()" -> it will print the item inside parentheses without terminating the line.
 *     to create new line use "\n" i.e. "print("statement\n")"
 *     "\t" will add tab(4 space). 
 *      to print double quote, use an escape character "\" 
 *          ex: \"
 * : Machine will read the code inside "main(){//Code block}" from top to bottom left to right.
