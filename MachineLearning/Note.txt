Machine Learning:
    A field of computer that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn with data without being explicitly programmed. 

AI vs ML vs DL:
    - AI: A broad field that includes both machine learning and deep learning. It is a subset of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    - ML: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.
    - DL: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data and make predictions or decisions.

Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data to make predictions.
    Regression : Predicts a continuous value.
    Classification : Predicts a categorical value.

- Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data to identify patterns.
    Clusturing : Groups similar data points together.
    Dimensionality Reduction : Reduces the number of features in the data.
    Anamoly Detection : Identifies data points that are different from the rest.
    Assosiation Rule Mining : Finds relationships between data points.
    
- semi-Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Types of machine learning algorithms based on types of training:
    Online Learning: The algorithm is trained on a stream of data. 
    Batch or Offline Learning: The algorithm is trained on a fixed dataset, but the data is not available at the time of training.
