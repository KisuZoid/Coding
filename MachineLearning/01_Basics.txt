>> Machine Learning:
    A field of computer that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn with data without being explicitly programmed. 

>> AI vs ML vs DL:
    - AI: A broad field that includes both machine learning and deep learning. It is a subset of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    - ML: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.
    - DL: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data and make predictions or decisions.

>> Types of ML based on supervision:
    - Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data to make predictions.
        Regression : Predicts a continuous value.
        Classification : Predicts a categorical value.

    - Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data to identify patterns.
        Clusturing : Groups similar data points together.
        Dimensionality Reduction : Reduces the number of features in the data.
        Anamoly Detection : Identifies data points that are different from the rest.
        Assosiation Rule Mining : Finds relationships between data points.
        
    - semi-Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
    - Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

>> Types of machine learning based on production:
    - Online Learning: The algorithm is trained on a stream of data. (data is feeded sequencely mini batch wise and It learns/improve on the go while using the ML model on server)
    - Batch or Offline Learning: The algorithm is trained on a fixed dataset. working large amount of data, First train with data offline then deploy over servers.

    >> Offline Learning: 
        - Problem with Batch Learning: 
            The algorithm may not perform well on new data that is not in the training set. 
            We have to update the model with new data to keep it up to date, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

        - Disadvantage of Batch ML:
            1. Lots of data 
            2. Hardware Limitation 
            3. Avalibility of data (data is not available at the time of training)
        
        - When to use Batch Learning:
            1. When the data is not changing frequently.
            2. When the data is not available in real-time.
            3. When the data is too large to be processed in real-time.

    >> Online Learning:        
        - When to use online learning:
            1. Where there is concept drift (data distribution changes over time)
            2. Cost effective (no need to store large amount of data)
            3. Real time prediction (e.g. stock prices, weather forecast)
            4. Faster Solution

        - Disadvantage:
            1. Tricky to use (need to handle concept drift)
            2. Risky (if the model is not good, it can lead to poor performance)

        - Learning Rate : The rate at which the algorithm learns from the data. A high learning rate can lead to over fitting, while a low learning rate can lead to underfitting. i.e. have to maintain correct learning rate to get correct results.

>> Types of ML based Learning:
    1. Instance-based learning: The algorithm learns from individual instances of data. (e.g. K-Nearest Neighbors)
    2. Model-based learning: The algorithm learns from a model of the data. (e.g. Bayesian Networks)
