//Inheritance:

//we can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
//Existing class is called base class
//New class is called derived class
//reusing classes saves time and money
//There are different types of inheritance in c++
    /*
    --> Single inheritance 
        a derived class with only one base class(Base --> derived)

    --> Mutiple inheritance
        a derived class with more than one base class(Base1 --> derived <-- Base2)

    --> Hierarchical inheritance
        several derived classes from a single base class (derived1 <-- Base --> derived2)

    --> Multilevel inheritance
        deriving a class from already derived class (Base --> derived1 --> derived2)

    --> Hybrid inheritance
        a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.(derived2 <-- Base --> derived1 >> derived1 --> derived3 <-- derived2)
