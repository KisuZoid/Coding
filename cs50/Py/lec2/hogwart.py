#List(count starts from 0)

students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"] #students is a variable for list of 3 student.
#if we want to show particular student let say Hermione so use variable name and position of hermione in sq. bracket. i.e. 0 in this case. 

print(students[0])









#List and Array both are mutable and store ordered items.
#List can store element of different types, but arrays can store element of same type.
#List provides more flexibility as it does not require explicit looping, but arrays require explicit looping to print elements.
